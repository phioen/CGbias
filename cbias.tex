\begin{abstract}
{\it Euclid} will image about two billion galaxies that can be used to infer cosmological
parameters using weak gravitational lensing. Exploiting the precision afforded by these
data relies critically on our ability to correct for instrumental effects, such as the convolution
by the point spread function (PSF). A complication is the fact  that the optical data
are obtained using a broad bandpass (550-920\,nm) while the diffraction-limited PSF depends
on wavelength. This leads to biases in the recovered galaxy shapes because the colours of 
galaxies vary spatially.  We show that the colour-gradient bias can be determined with high accuracy in simulated
noisy data. We also find that higher order image distortions, such as flexion, enhance
the bias, which may be relevant for the study of lensing in high density regions.
We estimate the size of this colour-gradient biases using multi-band observations 
from the {\it Hubble} Space Telescope and find correlations with the colours and sizes of
the galaxies, but do not observe a significant dependence with redshift. 
{\bf We need some concluding remark about the impact for Euclid.}

\section{Introduction}

The images of distant galaxies are distorted, or sheared, by the tidal effect of the gravitational  potential generated by intervening matter; an effect commonly referred to as weak gravitational lensing \citep[see e.g.][for a detailed introduction]{Bartelmann01}. The resulting correlations in the shapes can be related directly to the statistical properties of the mass distribution in the Universe, which in turn provide depend on cosmological parameters. Hence weak gravitational lensing by large-scale structure, or cosmic shear, has been identified as a powerful tool for cosmology. The measurement of the signal as a function of cosmological time is sensitive to the expansion history and the growth rate of large-scale structures, and thus can be used to constrain models for dark energy and modified gravity.

A useful measurement of the cosmic shear signal requires averaging over large numbers of galaxies
to reduce the uncertainty caused by the intrinsic ellipticities of galaxies. The result is, however, only meaningful if biases in the shape estimates are negligible. Various instrumental effects change the observed ellipticities by more than the typical lensing signal, which is of order one per cent. The most dominant source of bias is the smearing of the images by the point spread function (PSF), driving the desire for space-based observations \citep{Paulin-Henriksson08, Massey13}.
Despite these observational challenges, the most recent cosmic shear studies are starting to yield competitive constraints on cosmological parameters \citep{Heymans13, Jarvis16,Jee16,Hildebrandt17}. These results are based on surveys of modest areas of the sky, which limits their ability to study the nature of dark energy; to achieve that requires more than an order of magnitude improvement in precision.

Such a measurement is the objective of {\it Euclid} \citep{Laureijs11}, the dark energy mission of the European Space Agency (ESA) that will survey the 15\,000 deg$^2$ of extragalactic sky that have both low extinction and zodiacal light. To reduce the detrimental effects of noise on the shape measurements, the images used for the lensing analysis are observed using a wide bandpass (550-920\,nm). The much smaller PSF in space-based observations 
is a major advantage, but the diffraction-limited PSF leads to new complications. 

The most prominent one is that the correction for the smearing by the chromatic PSF depends on the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the galaxy of interest \citep{Cypriano10, Eriksen17} and ignoring this would lead to significant biases in the case of {\it Euclid}. Fortunately this can be accounted for using the supporting broad-band observations that are used to derive photometric redshifts for the sources: the correction employs an effective PSF which is derived from the estimate of the observed SED of the galaxy. This correction is sufficient if the SED does not vary spatially. If this is not the case, the underlying brightness distribution, which is needed for an unbiased estimate of the shear, cannot be unambiguously recovered from the observed images.
This results in a higher order systematic bias, which we call colour-gradient (hereafter CG) bias.
As shown by \cite{Semboloni13} (\citetalias{Semboloni13} in the rest of this paper) the amplitude depends on several factors: the SED of the galaxy, the relative size of the galaxy compared to the PSF, and the width of the bandpass, $\Delta\lambda$.  For instance, the bias scales as $\Delta\lambda^2$, and thus is particularly relevant in the case of {\it Euclid}.

Galaxies show a wide variety in colour gradients, with elliptical galaxies typically showing negative colour gradients (redder in the centre and bluer in the outskirts), with steeper gradients more commonly found in bluer or more luminous early type galaxies \citep[e.g.][]{2011MNRAS.414.3052D,
2011MNRAS.411.1151G}. Moreover, correlations between colour gradients and the overall colours and luminosities of the galaxies have been inferred \citep[e.g.][]{2010AJ....140.1528L, 2016A&A...593A..84K}.
Hence the relation between galaxy morphology and density may cause the CG bias to vary across the sky and may lead to correlations with the lensing signal itself. 

It is important that all systematic sources of biases are accounted for to a level that is smaller than the 
statistical uncertainties. In the case of {\it Euclid} this leads to tight requirements, as detailed in 
\cite{Massey13} and \cite{Cropper13}. Initial studies by \cite{Voigt12} and \citetalias{Semboloni13} used simulated images to show that the CG bias could be substantial,
exceeding nominal requirements for the multiplicative bias in the shear. They also argued
that it should be possible to calibrate the bias using {\it Hubble} Space Telescope (HST) observations
of a large sample of galaxies in the F606W and F814W filters. However, their conclusions are based on the analysis of simulated noiseless data. In this work, we revisit the issue of the calibration of CG bias,
with a particular focus on determining the bias from data with realistic noise levels. 

In Sect.~\ref{sec:concepts}, we describe the main concepts and introduce the notation. We present the results from the analysis of simulated images in Sect.~\ref{sec:simulations}. In particular we explore the  impact of having to use noisy data to measure the CG bias in Sect.~\ref{sec:noisy}.
In Sect.~\ref{sec:candels} we estimate the CG bias using HST observations from the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey \citep[CANDELS;][]{Koekemoer11}.

\section{The origin of colour gradient bias}
\label{sec:concepts}

Following the notation of \citetalias{Semboloni13}, we consider an image of a galaxy, and denote the photon brightness
distribution of the image at each position $\bm \theta$ and wavelength $\lambda$ by $I({\bm \theta};\lambda)$, which is related to the intensity $S({\bm\theta};\lambda)$ by $I^0(\theta;\lambda)=\lambda S({\bm\theta};\lambda)
T(\lambda)$, where $T(\lambda)$ is the normalised transmission. We take this to be a top-hat with a
width $\Delta\lambda$ around a central wavelength $\lambda_{\rm cen}$. The resulting image of the galaxy, observed using a telescope with a PSF $P({\bm \theta};\lambda)$  is given by:
%
\be
I^{\rm obs}({\bm\theta}) = \int_{\Delta\lambda} I^0({\bm\theta}; \lambda) *  
P({\bm \theta},\lambda)\, \d \lambda,
\label{eq:iobs}
\ee
%
where $*$ denotes a convolution. 

A measurement of the ellipticity of a galaxy provides an unbiased (but noisy) estimate of the 
weak gravitational lensing signal, quantified by the complex shear $\gamma=\gamma_1+\ii\gamma_2$.
The ellipticity $\epsilon$ in turn can be determined from the second order brightness moments $Q^0_{ij}$ of the PSF-corrected image $I^0(\theta)$:
%
\be
\epsilon_1+\ii \epsilon_2 \approx \frac{Q^0_{11} - Q^0_{22} + 2 \ii Q^0_{12} }
{Q^0_{11} + Q^0_{22} +2(Q^0_{11}Q^0_{22} - (Q^0_{12})^2)^{1/2}}
\elabel{mshear}
\ee
%
where the second order brightness moments are given by\footnote{We implicitly assume that the moments are evaluated around the position where the dipole moments vanish.}
%
\be
Q^0_{ij} = {1 \over F} \int  I^{0}({\bm \theta})\, \theta_i \theta_j \, \d^2 {\bm \theta} \quad\; (i,j=1,2),
\ee
%
where $F=\int \d^2{{\bm\theta}}  I^{0}({\bm\theta})$ is the total observed photon flux.

In practice, however, the observed moments are measured from the PSF-convolved image given by
Eqn.~(\ref{eq:iobs}). Moreover, the moments are evaluated using a weight function $W({\bm\theta})$  to reduce the effect of noise in the images. Hence, the observed quadrupole moments are given by
\be
Q^{\rm obs}_{ij} = {1 \over F_{\rm w}} \int_{\Delta\lambda} \d\lambda \int \d^2 {\bm\theta} \,
I^0(\theta; \lambda) *  P(\theta,\lambda)\, \theta_i \theta_j \, W({\bm \theta})\,,
\ee
%
where $F_{\rm w}$ is the weighted flux. The use of a weight function biases the observed moments, 
and the aim of moment-based shape measurement algorithms is to correct for this using estimates of the higher order moments \citep[e.g.][]{Kaiser1995,Melchior11}. An alternative approach is to fit sheared, PSF-convolved models to the observed images 
\citep[e.g.][]{Bridle02,Miller13}; in these fitting methods the profile itself acts as a weight. 

\citetalias{Semboloni13} showed that the inevitable use of a weight function gives rise to the CG bias.
Consequently, the bias depends on the choice of the weight function, and vanishes in the case of {\it unweighted} moments. In the latter case it possible to determine the PSF-corrected moments $Q^0_{ij}$ from the observed quadrupole moments because
%
\be
Q^{\rm obs}_{ij}=Q^0_{ij}+P^{\rm eff}_{ij} \,\label{eq:unweighted}
\ee
%
for unweighted moments, where $P^{\rm eff}_{ij}$ are the quadrupole moments of the effective PSF,  defined as
\be
P_{\rm eff}({\bm \theta}) = \frac{1}{F} \int \d \lambda\, P({\bm \theta},\lambda)\, F(\lambda) \,,
\ee
where   $F(\lambda)$ is the photon flux as a function of wavelength, which is directly related to the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the galaxy. Hence the correction for the chromatic PSF requires an estimate of the SED.  \cite{Eriksen17} have shown that the broadband observations that are used to determine photometric redshifts for {\it Euclid} can also be used to estimate the effective PSF with sufficient accuracy to meet the stringent requirements presented in \cite{Cropper13}.

%
\begin{figure*}
\includegraphics[width=12.5cm]{colourg.eps}
\caption{Flowchart describing how the colour-gradient bias is determined. The initial image
is the same in both flows, but in the top flow an image without a colour gradient is created
to which a shear is applied. In the bottom flow, the image is sheared before the PSF steps
are applied. The ellipticities of the resulting images differ slightly, and can be used to quantify
the bias that is introduced.}
\label{fig:flowchart}
\end{figure*}
%

We limit our study of the CG bias to the multiplicative bias it introduces, and our approach to quantify 
the impact on the lensing signal is similar to \citetalias{Semboloni13}. Figure~\ref{fig:flowchart} shows the flowchart of the steps that enable us to evaluate the CG bias.  In both cases we start with the same wavelength dependent image $I^0({\bm \theta};\lambda)$, but the bottom flow resembles what happens in the actual observations: the original image is sheared\footnote{We use 
$\gamma_1=0.05$  and $\gamma_2=0.02$ as reference, but we verified that other values yield similar results.} before the convolution with the PSF. The deconvolution with the effective PSF then yields the PSF-corrected shape. In the top flow the PSF steps are applied first, resulting in an image without a colour gradient that is subsequently sheared. 

We measure the ellipticities of the resulting images to estimate the CG bias. To reduce noise in our estimate of the multiplicative bias $m$ we use the ring-test method \citep{Nakajima07} where we create eight copies of the original galaxy but with different orientations. The ensemble averaged ellipticities then  provide an estimate of the multiplicative CG bias, $m$ (we do not explore additive bias here), via
%
\be
m= {\epsilon_i^{\rm CG} \over \epsilon_i^{\rm NCG} }-1,
\ee
%
where `CG' indicates the case where the galaxy has a colour gradient, and `NCG' is the galaxy
with a uniform colour. Note that our approach differs slightly from that in \citetalias{Semboloni13}, who quantify the response of the observed ellipticity to an applied shear. Hence, they do not apply the last step
in the bottom flow (the deconvolution), but rather convolve the final image in the top flow. 
The steps presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:flowchart} yield a more symmetric result, highlighting the fact
that the CG bias is the consequence of the fact that the shearing of the image does not commute 
with the convolution with the PSF. However, we verify in Sect.~\ref{sec:simulations} that we recover
the results of \citetalias{Semboloni13} (see Fig.~\ref{fig:biasofweight}). 

Recently, \cite{Huff17} proposed a technique to infer multiplicative shear calibration parameters that avoids the use of extensive image simulations, such as those described in \citep{Hoekstra17}. They quantify the 
sensitivity to a known shear by applying it to the observed data. Hence, their approach follows the top flow in Fig.~\ref{fig:flowchart} and thus cannot account for CG bias. 

\section{Colour gradient bias in simulated data}
\label{sec:simulations}

The CG bias is a higher order systematic bias, and thus the changes in the measured ellipticities are small. It is therefore important to verify that numerical errors in the calculations are subdominant compared to the small effects we aim to measure. To do so, we compare results from two independent codes that are used to generate the simulated images: one is written in C/C++ and the other uses the
python-based {\sc GalSim} package \citep{Rowe15}, which is widely used to created simulated images \citep[e.g.][]{FenechConti17, Hoekstra17}. 
  
In the C code we compute the image by multiplying the surface brightness at the centre of each pixel using a sheared S{\'e}rsic profile with the pixel area. In the case of {\sc GalSim} we use the {\sc Shear()} function (which convolves the image by the pixel). Since we are interested in small differences in the shapes of
deconvolved images, we first examined the size of potential numerical errors. We therefore convolved and
subsequently deconvolved elliptical images. Comparison of the recovered ellipticities revealed small differences between the codes that ranged from $10^{-7}$ to $10^{-6}$, two orders of magnitude
smaller than the CG biases we are concerned with. Hence can safely neglect this numerical artefacts here.

As a further test we compare directly to the results obtained by \citetalias{Semboloni13} for two reference galaxy models.  The reference galaxies are modeled as the sum of a bulge and disk component. To describe the wavelength dependence of the images we use the galaxy SED templates from \citet{1980ApJS...43..393C}: we use the SED for an elliptical galaxy for the bulge and take the SED of an irregular galaxy for the disk. This choice ensures that the resulting colour gradients are large. The two components are  described by a circular S{\'e}rsic profile:
\be
I_{\rm S}(\theta) = I_0 {\rm e}^{-\kappa\; \left(\frac{\theta}{a}\right)^{1/n}},
\ee
%
where $I_0$ is the central intensity, and $\kappa=1.9992\,n -0.3271$. For the bulge component we adopt $n=1.5$ and for the disk we use $n=1$. The profiles are normalised such that the bulge contains 25\% of the flux at a wavelength of 550\,nm. The galaxies are circular and the sizes for the bulge and disk for galaxy `B'   are $0\farcs17$ and $1\farcs2$, respectively. The second galaxy `S' is smaller with sizes of $0\farcs09$ and $0\farcs6$  for the bulge and disk, respectively (also see Table~3 in \citetalias{Semboloni13}). We create images with a size of  $256\times256$ pixels, and resolution $0.05$ arcsec/pixel at wavelengths 1\,nm apart and sum these in the range $550-920$\,nm to mimic the {\it Euclid} pass-band.

To create the PSF-convolved images we consider several PSF profiles. For a direct comparison with \citetalias{Semboloni13} we use their reference PSF1. As discussed in \citetalias{Semboloni13} this PSF has a similar size as the nominal {\it Euclid} PSF, but a steeper wavelength-dependence. Our implementation of the pipeline was able to reproduce the results presented in \citetalias{Semboloni13}.
To better approximate the {\it Euclid} PSF \citetalias{Semboloni13} also considered a model that  consists of a compact Gaussian core and an appropriately scaled top-hat (their PSF3). Instead we use here a more realistic obscured Airy profile, which is actually close to the {\it Euclid} design profile \citep{Laureijs11}:
%
\be
P(\theta) = {I_0 \over (1-\epsilon^2)^2} \rund{{2J_1(\theta)\over \theta} - 
{2\epsilon J_1(\epsilon \theta) \over \theta}}^2,
\elabel{psfairy}
\ee
%
where $I_0$ is the maximum intensity at the center, $\epsilon$ is the aperture obscuration ratio, and $J_1(x)$ is the first kind of Bessel function of order one; $x$ is defined as $x=\pi \theta/\lambda\, D $.
In the case of {\it Euclid}, $D=1.2$m and $\epsilon=1/3$. We compare this model to the Gaussian
case and PSF3 from \citetalias{Semboloni13} in Fig.~\ref{fig:psfmodel} at the 550\,nm and 920\,nm.

\begin{figure}
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=\hsize]{zairy.eps}}
\caption{Comparison of the obscured Airy profile (solid), which is a good approximation
to the {\it Euclid} PSF, to PSF1 (Gaussian; dashed) and PSF3 (compact Gaussian and 
top-hat; dotted) from \citetalias{Semboloni13}. The profiles for 550\,nm are indicated by the blue lines and
the results for 920\,nm are shown in red.}
\label{fig:psfmodel}
\end{figure}
%

As discussed in Sect.~\ref{sec:concepts} the amplitude of the noise bias depends on the width of the weight function that is used to compute the (weighted) quadrupole moments. In Fig.~\ref{fig:biasofweight} we show the CG bias for the two reference galaxies as a function of $\theta_{\rm w}$, the width of the weight function that is used to compute the quadrupole moments. The results from the {\sc C} code (dashed lines) and the {\sc GalSim} code (dotted lines) agree very well for both the large galaxy `B' (red lines) and the small galaxy `S' (blue lines). Given the consistent results between the {\sc C} and {\sc GalSim} code we conclude that numerical errors are negligible in our implementation. In the remainder, we limit the simulations to those generated with {\tt GalSim}.

Figure~\ref{fig:biasofweight} shows that the CG bias decreases rapidly when the width of the weight function is increased. This allows for an interesting trade-off between CG bias and noise bias. The latter increases with increasing $\theta_{\rm w}$ but relatively slowly (see Fig.~4 in \citetalias{Semboloni13}). As a proxy for the optimal weight function (which maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio) we adopt the value of the 
half-light radius in the remainder of this paper. This yields $m=0.8\times10^{-3}$ for galaxy `B' and
$m=2\times10^{-3}$ for galaxy `S', demonstrating that the CG bias is a strong function of galaxy size.

  PSF. The dashed (dash-dotted) lines are our
  results for images simulated using the {\sc C} ({\sc GalSim}) code.}

\subsection{Impact in high-density regions}

The focus of this paper is to quantify the impact of CG bias on cosmic shear measurements, 
i.e. we consider only small distortions in the shapes of the sources. However, {\it Euclid} will
also enable the calibration of the masses of galaxy clusters with unprecedented precision.
\cite{Koehlinger15} have shown that this should be possible given the accuracy required 
for the shape measurement algorithms for cosmic shear. This does implicitly assume that the 
performance does not change in high density environments. Blending does impact the performance
\citep{Hoekstra17}, but can be accounted for. In this section we focus instead on the unexplored question
whether the CG bias differs in the central regions of galaxy clusters.

In high density regions, higher order distortions of the images can become dominant. For instance, flexion (the next order after shearing) has been studied as a potential observational tool
\citep[e.g.][]{2002ApJ...564...65G,bacon2006}. Rather than simply shearing the images, as we have done so far, in this section we use the full lens equation to perform ray tracing simulations instead. This enables
us to capture the effect of the higher order distortion. For this exercise we use the {\sc C} code, as it has
this functionality fully implemented. As a lens we consider a singular isothermal sphere (SIS) with
an Einstein radius $\theta_{\rm E}$; in this case the (tangential) shear is given by 
$\gamma_{\rm t}=$\textonehalf$\,\theta_{\rm E}/\theta$. To minimise numerical effects, the image sizes are increased to $2048\times2048$ pixels, with a resolution $0\farcs0125$/pixel. 

In Fig.~\ref{fig:biasofgamma} we show the CG bias as a function of the tangential shear
for different values of $\theta_{\rm E}$. The red lines indicate the results for the `B' galaxy
and the blue lines show the biases for the `S' galaxy. For small shears, i.e. far away from the lens,
the CG bias converges to the shear-only case that we have studied thus far (the thin horizontal lines).
Hence, for cosmic shear studies we can safely ignore this complication. However, as the source approaches the lens, the flexion signal increases, resulting in an increase in the  CG bias. The change depends on the value of $\theta_{\rm E}$, because flexion is lower for a given shear when the source is further away from the lens. Hence, the additional CG bias due to higher order distortions is expected to be relatively small for clusters of galaxies (for which $\theta_{\rm E}>10''$), but it can be relevant for studies 
of massive galaxies; in this case the Einstein radius is smaller, and the flexion signal larger. Figure~\ref{fig:biasofgamma} shows that for a lens with $\theta_{\rm E}=1''$ the CG bias rapidly increase when the shear $\gamma>0.15$, i.e. for $\theta<3''$. Thanks to the small PSF of {\it Euclid} it is possible to measure the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal on such small scales, which could in principle provide interesting constraints on the enclosed stellar mass. However, our findings indicate that colour gradients may prevent a robust measurement of the small-scale galaxy-galaxy lensing signal. This warrants further study that is beyond the scope of this paper.

%
\begin{figure}
  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=\hsize]{zcg_sis.eps}}
  \caption{The CG bias versus tangential shear when the full lens equation is used to compute the 
  image distortions. The red lines indicate the resulting CG bias for the `B' galaxy, whereas the blue
  lines correspond to the `S' galaxy. The bias depends on the Einstein radius, $\theta_{\rm E}$, of the
  lens, and is more prominent for small values of  $\theta_{\rm E}$ at a given shear amplitude.}
  \label{fig:biasofgamma}

\subsection{Calibration of CG bias using simulated HST images}
\label{sec:noisy}

The {\it Euclid} observations lack high-resolution multi-band images to measure the CG bias directly for each source galaxy. However, the cosmological lensing signal is typically inferred from the ellipticity correlation function, which involves  averaging the shapes of large ensembles of galaxies. Provided the average bias that is caused by colour gradients is known for a selection of sources, it is possible in principle to obtain unbiased estimates of the ellipticity correlation function. Here it is particularly important that the correction for the average CG bias accounts for the variation in redshift
and colour. The former is relevant for tomographic cosmic shear studies, whereas the latter avoids
significant spatial variation in the bias because of the correlation between galaxy colour, or morphology, and density.

\citetalias{Semboloni13} showed that HST observations  in both the F606W and F814W filters can be used to determine the CG bias to meet {\it Euclid} requirements. However, \citetalias{Semboloni13} did not consider the complicating factor that the HST images themselves are noisy. Although the HST data are typically deeper than the nominal {\it Euclid} data, and the HST PSF is considerably smaller, it is nonetheless necessary to investigate the impact of noise in more detail. We address this particular question here, before we determine the CG bias from actual HST data in Sect.~\ref{sec:candels}.

The method to calibrate the CG bias using observations in two bands is described in detail
in \citetalias{Semboloni13}, but here we outline the main steps for completeness. To model the
wavelength dependence of the image we use two narrow-band\footnote{To distinguish these filters from the broad VIS pass-band we refer to the F606W and F814W as narrow bands, but acknowledge that these are commonly referred to broad-band filters and that genuine narrow-band filters are significantly narrower.} images, each of which is given by:
%
\be
I_i({\bm\theta}) = \int_{\Delta \lambda_i} T_i(\lambda)\, I({\bm \theta},\lambda) \;\d \lambda,
\elabel{linearitp}
\ee
%
where $T_i(\lambda)$ is the transmission of the $i$th narrow filter. We assume that for each pixel the wavelength dependence of the image can be interpolated linearly:
%
\be
I({\bm \theta},\lambda) \approx  a_0({\bm \theta})+a_1({\bm \theta})\lambda.
\elabel{interpolate}
\ee
%
Eqs.\ref{eq:linearitp} and \ref{eq:interpolate} yield a linear set of
equations on each pixel, which can be used to solved for the
coefficients $a_i$:
%
\be
T_{0i} a_0(\theta) \,+\,T_{1i} a_1(\theta) = I_i(\theta), \quad\; i=1,2,
\elabel{lineareq}
\ee
%
where we defined 
\be
T_{ji}=\int_{\Delta\lambda_i} \d \lambda\,T_i(\lambda)\lambda^j. 
\ee
%
We thus obtain approximate galaxy images at each wavelength, which we use to estimate the CG bias, following the same procedure as we used in the previous section.

We first consider the recovery of the CG bias for noiseless observations of the two reference galaxies, as this represents the best-case scenario. We simulate the images in the F606W and F814W filters at different redshifts. We adopt the native sampling of the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) on HST of  $0\farcs05$ pixel$^{-1}$. As shown in \citetalias{Semboloni13}, we cannot ignore the blurring of the observed images by the HST PSF; to mimic this we assume an obscured Airy function for a mirror with diameter $D=2.5$ and obscuration  $0.33$ as a proxy for the HST PSF. We deconvolve our synthetic HST images and create the images at different wavelengths as the starting point for the flow presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:flowchart}.

Following \citetalias{Semboloni13}, we show Fig.~\ref{fig:biasofz50} the CG bias as a function of redshift for galaxy `B' (left panels) and `S' (right panels), demonstrating that the CG bias varies significantly with redshift. The results for the actual CG bias are indicated by the solid black lines, whereas the dashed black lines indicate the recovered values from the noiseless synthetic HST observations in the F606W and F814W filters.  The bottom panels show the residuals between the recovered and the true bias. The residual bias is within the target tolerance for {\it Euclid}, indicated by the grey band, for all redshifts.

  The dashed black line is the recovered bias when we mimic 
  noiseless HST observations in two filters. The solid red line
  indicates the results when we use the best fit {\sc GALFIT} model
  in both filters to estimate the CG bias when the simulated HST images have
  an input SNR$=50$ (averaged over 40 noise realisations at each
  redshift). The blue line shows the results when we fix the S{\'e}rsic index
  in the fit. The bottom panels show the residuals $\Delta m$ with respect
  to the true CG bias. The grey band indicates the 
  nominal {\it Euclid} requirement.}
\label{fig:biasofz50}
\end{figure*}

We now proceed to explore the impact of noise in the HST images. To do so, we add Gaussian noise to the simulated HST images, where the r.m.s. noise level $\sigma$ is determined by the signal-to-noise ratio of the galaxy, SNR; the total flux within an aperture of radius $1.5\times r_{\rm h}$, $F_{\rm tot}$; and the number of pixels within this aperture, $N_{\rm tot}$, such that
%
\be
\sigma = {F_{tot} \over {\rm SNR} \sqrt{N_{tot}} }.
\ee
%
For reference, we compared the input SNR for the two reference galaxies
to that estimated by {\sc SExtractor} \citep{Bertin96}.
We find good agreement for galaxy `B' for SNR values ranging from 5 to 50
in both HST filters. The agreement is also good for the `S' galaxy, but 
{\textsc SExtractor} returns lower values if the input SNR is larger than 30.
We consider two noise levels: a SNR=50 corresponds roughly to a 
VIS magnitude of $m_{\rm VIS}=23.7$, a bit brighter than the typical
galaxy used in the {\it Euclid} weak lensing analysis; a SNR=15 approximately 
corresponds to $m_{\rm VIS}=25.2$, the faintest galaxies that might be used.

The deconvolution of noisy images is problematic, because the presence of noise will lead to biased estimates of the underlying galaxy. Instead we regulate the problem by assuming that galaxies can be fit by a bulge and disk component, each described by a S{\'e}rsic profile. Real galaxies have more complex morphologies, including spiral arms, etc. To first order, however, the radial surface brightness profile is the most important quantity. This can be understood if we consider a galaxy and redistribute the flux in an arbitrary annulus equally into two points on the minor and two points on the major axis. In this case the azimuthally average profile is unchanged, as are the unweighted quadrupole moments. Hence Eqn.~(\ref{eq:unweighted}) is unchanged. The higher order moments are modified, thus affecting realistic shape measurements. However, the ensemble average of such galaxies with random position angles corresponds to the original galaxy. Hence the modified higher order moments are a source of noise, but should not bias the ensemble averaged measurement. This argument is correct in the presence of a axisymmetric PSF, but we note that PSF anisotropy will lead to a coupling with the higher order moments of the galaxy surface brightness and the PSF. Hence, further investigation with realistic morphologies is needed, but our approach should capture most of the CG bias in real data.

We fit the bulge and disk model, convolved with the PSF, to  the noisy images in each band and use the best fit model to compute the CG bias. To perform the fit, we use {\sc GALFIT} \citep{Peng10} with 
the prior constraints on the galaxy parameters (S{\'e}rsic index, effective radius, and axis ratio) listed in Table~\ref{fitpar}. We combine the images in the two filters and use {\sc SExtractor} to estimate the center and some of the initial galaxy parameters to be used as the starting point by {\sc GALFIT}. The resulting best fit images depend somewhat on these initial values, and thus could affect the  estimate for the CG bias. This will be more important when the SNR of the images is lower. To explore this we perform the fits using two sets of initial parameters: in the first we leave all parameters free, while in the other case we fix the S{\'e}rsic index to its simulated value, but leave the other parameters free.

We use the best fit models to compute the CG bias, following the same algorithm as was used to compute the signal in the noiseless case. We show the resulting average inferred CG bias in Fig.~\ref{fig:biasofz50} for SNR=50 as a function of redshift for the two reference galaxies (`B' in the left panel and `S' in the
right panel). The bottom panels in Fig.~\ref{fig:biasofz50} show the residuals 
$\Delta m$ with respect to the true multiplicative CG bias. To  determine the average
bias we analyse 6 rotations of the galaxy and use the average value as our estimate of 
the galaxy ellipticity \citep{Nakajima07}.  Moreover we create 40 noise realisations for 
each redshift to estimate the statistical uncertainty in our estimate of the multiplicative
CG bias, which is given by
%
\be
\sigma_m= |m| \sqrt{\rund{\sigma_{\rm cg} \langle e_{\rm cg} \rangle \over \langle e_{\rm ncg}\rangle^2 }^2
  + \rund{\sigma_{\rm ncg} \over \langle e_{\rm ncg} \rangle}^2 },
\elabel{sigmam}
\ee
%
where $\sigma_{\rm ncg}$ and $\sigma_{\rm cg}$ are the uncertainties in the average
ellipticities for the images without and with a colour gradient, respectively.

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=8.0cm]{zs2n15his.eps}
  \caption{Histogram of the inferred CG bias for the `B' (blue) and
  `S' (red) galaxy when narrow band observations with SNR=15
  are used. The histogram combines the results for the different
  redshifts.}
  \label{fig:histogrambias}
\end{figure}

We find that fixing the S{\'e}rsic index (blue line) or leaving all parameters free (red line) results in a similar CG bias as a function of redshift. Moreover, the results closely resemble the noiseless case (dashed lines).  
The residuals presented in the bottom panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:biasofz50} show that  for the SNR=50 case, we expect that the average CG bias can be determined with an overall accuracy that meets the adopted {\it Euclid} tolerance, indicated by the grey band. Only for the `S' galaxy is the residual outside the nominal range at low redshifts, but we note that the reference galaxies have rather extreme colour gradients.
Moreover, the significant deviations at $z=0.5$ and $0.9$ arise because the adopted SED of the disk (Irr) contains strong emission lines  \citepalias[see Fig.~1 in][]{Semboloni13}. These lines enter and exit the F606W filter at these redshifts, respectively, and the linear approximation for the wavelength
dependence fails. In these, albeit extreme cases, two-band imaging may not be sufficient. To what extent this will affect the estimate of the CG bias requires further study.

%

The average CG bias for a particular subset of galaxies can be used to correct the ellipticity correlation function. This, however, increases the shape noise, especially if the distribution of biases is broad. 
Fortunately, Fig.~\ref{fig:histogrambias} shows the distribution of multiplicative CG bias (combining results for the full redshift range) when the galaxies are detected in the narrow-band images with SNR=15.
The distribution is skewed, and as expected, the broadest for the `S' galaxy. Nonetheless the increase in shape noise due to an empirical correction for CG bias is negligible. We did increase the number of noise realisation to 1000 to ensure robust estimates of the average CG bias as a function of redshift. The resulting CG bias as a function of redshift are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:biasofz15}. We also show the median bias as a function of redshift, which is slightly different, because the distribution itself is skewed. Nonetheless the bias is recovered to a level that is acceptable for {\it Euclid}.

lines we  increase the size of PSF for the F606W images.}

\end{figure}

\subsection{PSF variations narrow-band data}
\label{sec:psfmodel}

So far we implicitly assumed that the simple axisymmetric PSF used to mimic the HST data
is perfectly known. In reality, however, the HST PSF is more complex, and varies spatially
and as a function of time. The small field-of-view of ACS typically results in a relatively small number
of stars that can be used to model the PSF, although most of the variation can be captured with
few parameters \citep[e.g.][]{Schrabback10}; of these focus variations are the most dominant. We therefore examine next how well the HST PSF  properties need to be determined so that they do not affect the CG bias measurement significantly. 

To do so, we first generate models where we slightly increase the PSF size in the two bands by computing the  Airy profile when the wavelength in the calculation is increased by a factor 1.05, 1.10 and 1.15 for the three cases. This results in increases in the FWHM of 0.9\% between the difference cases.  These models are used only in the step where we deconvolve the simulated HST images in the absence of noise. The change in CG bias, $\Delta m$ as a function of redshift is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:psfacc1} for the `B' galaxy (top panel) and `S' galaxy (bottom panel).  The results for an increase in the PSF size in  the F606W band are indicated by the solid, dashed and dotted lines, respectively; the red, green and blue lines indicate the impact of increasing the size of the PSF in the F814W band. The sensitivity to the PSF errors is typically larger for low redshift galaxies, but the change in CG bias is much smaller than the bias itself.  As expected, small galaxies are more sensitive to errors in the estimate of the PSF size.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=8.0cm]{ztinytim_b.eps}
\includegraphics[width=8.0cm]{ztinytim_s.eps}
\caption{Difference in CG bias when the reference {\sc TinyTim} PSF is used to deconvolve
the synthetic HST data (blue lines) or when we mimic the PSF modelling (red lines). The top
panel shows the results for the reference galaxy `B', whereas the bottom panel shows results
for galaxy `S'. The differences are small, suggesting that the bias is not particularly sensitive to 
errors in the adopted HST PSF model.}
\label{fig:psfacc2}
\end{figure}

To mimic a more realistic scenario we generated mock star fields using simulated PSFs generated with
the {\sc TinyTim} tool \citep{2011SPIE.8127E..0JK}. To compute the reference PSFs at the various positions on the detector in the F606W and F814W filters we used the default parameters where possible, including the appropriate camera, detector, and filter passband settings for each image. We adopt the K7V spectrum for the SED, which represents a typical stellar SED in the sample (the choice of a fixed spectrum for stars was found to have a negligible impact on the models.). We select stars with a signal-to-noise ratio larger than $50$, and ensure there are no detected objects within $1$ arcsecond ($20$ pixels), and outlier rejection is performed in the fitting procedure. The postage stamps of the star images for each filter are normalised and then stacked using inverse-variance weighting. This PSF is then used to determine the colour gradient bias from the synthetic HST images of the two reference galaxies (which are convolved with an obscured Airy function for a mirror with diameter D = 2.5 and obscuration 0.33 as a proxy for the HST PSF). The blue lines in Fig.~\ref{fig:psfacc2} show the resulting difference in CG bias for the `B' (top panel) and `S' galaxy (bottom panel) as a function of redshift. Although this represents a relatively significant mismatch in PSFs, the change in bias is quite small.

To mimic modeling errors that would occur in reality we select simulated PSF images at a nearby position on the detector (from a grid of points) and fitted for the focus values. The corresponding model PSFs are stacked using the same weights as before. The resulting change in CG bias for the `B' (top panel) and `S' galaxy (bottom panel) as a function of redshift as shown by the red lines. The differences between the two TinyTim PSF models is well within requirements, even for the `S' galaxy. These results therefore confirm the
conclusion of \citetalias{Semboloni13}  that the uncertainty in the HST PSF model has a negligible impact on the determination of the CG bias.

\section{Measurement from HST observations}
\label{sec:candels}

In the previous section we confirmed the conclusion from \citetalias{Semboloni13} 
that it is possible to determine the CG bias from HST observations in the F606W 
and F814W filters. Importantly, we demonstrated that the presence of noise in the 
actual data should not bias the results significantly. We therefore proceed now to
determine the expected CG bias in {\it Euclid} shape measurements using
realistic galaxy populations. To do so, we employ HST/ACS data taken in the F606W and F814W
filters in the three CANDELS fields (AEGIS, COSMOS, and UDS), which have
a roughly homogeneous coverage in both bands \citep[see][]{davis2007,grogin2011,Koekemoer11}.

\begin{figure*}
  \hbox{

  \caption{Histogram of the distributions in observed half-light radii ($R_{\rm h}$; left panel),
  photometric redshift (middle panel) and F606W-F814W colour (right panel) for the three
  CANDELS fields (AEGIS, COSMOS, UDS). We show results for galaxies with $m_{\rm VIS}<25$,
  where the results for the three fields are normalised by area.}
  \label{fig:datapro1}
\end{figure*}
%

We base our analysis on a tile-wise reduction of the ACS data, incorporating pointings that have at least four exposures to facilitate good cosmic ray removal, yielding combined exposure times of 1.3-2.3ks in F606W and 2.1-3.0ks in F814W.  We employ the updated correction for charge-transfer inefficiency from \cite{massey2014}, \texttt{MultiDrizzle} \citep{koekemoer2003} for the cosmic ray removal and stacking, as well as careful shift refinement, optimised weighting, and masking for stars and image artefacts as detailed in \cite{Schrabback10}.  \cite{Schrabback16} created weak lensing catalogues based on these images, and we refer to this paper for more detail.  We base our analysis on the galaxies that pass their source selection and apply additional magnitude cuts as detailed below. To investigate the dependence of the colour gradient influence on galaxy colour and redshift, we match this galaxy catalogue to the photometric redshift catalogue from \cite{skelton14}.  

To resemble the selection of galaxies in the {\it Euclid}  wide survey, we derive an approximate estimate for the flux in the VIS-band using:
%
\be
f_{\rm VIS}=f_{606}+ 0.55\,(f_{606}-f_{814}),
\ee
%
where $f_{606}$ and $f_{814}$ are the total fluxes from \cite{skelton14} and convert this to a magnitude. This estimate is a simple linear interpolation of the fluxes in the two HST filters to the adopted central wavelength of VIS, which we took to be 735\,nm (which defines the slope of 0.55). We select galaxies brighter than $m_{\rm VIS}=25$.  The resulting sample sizes for the  three CANDELS fields are listed in Table~\ref{table:mag}. The number densities are in line with expectations for {\it Euclid} \citep{Laureijs11}.
Most galaxies in our sample are detected with an $SNR>15$, and we thus  expect to be able to determine the CG bias accurately.  In Fig.~\ref{fig:datapro1} we present histograms of some of the relevant galaxy properties for the three fields. We observe no significant differences, but note that we find more blue galaxies in AEGIS.

\subsection{CG bias from CANDELS}

We now proceed to apply the procedure we tested on synthetic galaxies on the HST observations to determine the expected CG bias for {\it Euclid}. We use the default TinyTim PSF when we fit the single component S{\'e}rsic models to the observations using {\sc GALFIT} (see \S\ref{sec:psfmodel}).
We adopt priors on the S{\'e}rsic index ($0.5<n<5.0$), the effective radius ($1<r_e<50$ pixel) and axis ratio ($0.6<q<1.0$). We assume that the Airy model (Eq.\,\ref{eq:psfairy}) is a good representation of the {\it Euclid} PSF. As described in \ref{sec:noisy} we interpolate the SED on each pixel of the model galaxy to generate a wavelength dependent image (Eq.\ref{eq:linearitp} - \ref{eq:lineareq}), which is integrated and convolved to  create the images with and without colour gradients. We create images with six different orientations to reduce estimate the multiplicative shear bias $m$ caused by colour gradients.

The top panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:cgbhis} shows the histogram of the CG bias for the three CANDELS fields that we study here. The mean bias is $1.1\times 10^{-4}$ and the distribution is quite peaked, with biases less than 0.01 for 94\% of the galaxies. Note that the observed distribution will be slightly broadened due to noise in the HST images (cf. the red histogram in Fig.~\ref{fig:histogrambias}). For reference we show in the bottom panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:cgbhis} the histogram if we adopt a  weight function that is twice as large
($2\times r_{\rm h}$) to measure the shapes. As expected, the bias decreases by about one order of magnitude. Although an increase in the width of the weight function is thus a potentially interesting approach to reduce the impact of the CG bias, we note that our nominal implementation already suggests that the average  bias is small. 

%
\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\hsize]{zhiscgb.eps}
  \includegraphics[width=\hsize]{zhiscgbno.eps}
\caption{Histogram of the estimated multiplicative bias caused by colour gradients using HST 
observations. The results for the three different CANDELS fields are indicated by the different
colours. The top panel shows the distribution for our nominal choice for the width of the weight
function, whereas the bottom panel shows that increasing the width to twice the half-light radius
reduces the biases by an order of magnitude. }
\label{fig:cgbhis}
\end{figure}

The amplitude of the CG bias depends on a number of parameters, such as the redshift and colour. Hence it is not sufficient to consider the average bias for the source sample. We therefore need to explore such trends using our HST measurements. We start with two quantities that should be directly related to 
the CG bias, namely the ratio of the S{\'e}rsic index in the two HST filters and the ratio of the effective
radii in the two band. The results are presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:cg2fitpar}. The top panel shows that the
average CG bias does not depend significantly on the ratio of S{\'e}rsic indices; we do observe a significant trend when we consider the ratio of effective radii (bottom panel). This is not surprising, because the bias in shape measurements depends to leading order on the galaxy size \citep{Massey13}. Note that the average CG bias in Fig.~\ref{fig:cg2fitpar} vanishes  when $r_{\rm eff,606}=r_{\rm eff, 814}$: in this case there should be no significant colour gradient (as the difference in S{\'e}rsic index has only a minor impact).

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\hsize]{zcgbheat-ne29.eps}
\includegraphics[width=\hsize]{zcgbheat-re29.eps}
\caption{Multiplicative CG bias as a function of structural parameters in the fit to the surface brightness
profiles in the F606W and F814W filters. {\it Top panel:} bias as a function

errorbars shows the average and its uncertainty. {\it Bottom panel:} bias as a function of effective
radii in the F814W and F606W filters. We observe a clear trend in the average bias as a function of
this ratios}
\label{fig:cg2fitpar}
\end{figure}

These structural parameters are, however, not observable using the {\it Euclid} data. Instead we proceed to examine trends with observable properties that correlate with the lensing signal itself, namely source redshift and colour (as galaxies tend to be redder in high density regions). We show the CG bias as a function
of the $m_{606}-m_{814}$ colour in the left panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:cg2color}, which shows that the average
bias decreases for redder galaxies.

  galaxies respectively. The lines are the average CG bias in the
  redshift bins.}
\label{fig:cg2color}
\end{figure*}


As the mean colour varies with redshift, we show the CG bias as a function of redshift in the right panel of
Fig.~\ref{fig:cg2color}.  Because the bias depends on colour, we split the sample into two groups. The average bias for the red galaxies ($m_{606}-m_{814}>0.5$) is indicated by the red line. The bias is negative and nearly constant over the redshift range of interest. The average bias for blue galaxies (defined as $m_{606}-m_{814}<0.5$) is nearly zero over the full range. The average CG biases and their dispersions for the two samples in various broad redshift bins are listed in Table~\ref{table:calibration}.

%It has been observed that bluer galaxies have positive colour gradients, while the redder ones
%have negative gradients \citep[e.g.][]{2010MNRAS.407..144T}. Since this may mark a possible transition of two types of galaxies, we split the galaxy sample into two groups according to their colour: the red galaxies ($m_{V-I}>0.5$) and the blue ones ($m_{V-I}<0.5$). {\bf In this case you would like to split by rest-frame

\end{table}

Although the lack of resolved multi-colour data from {\it Euclid} prevents us from
measuring colour gradients directly, it may be possible to use some of the morphological
information that can be obtained from the VIS image. This is supported by the results
presented in Fig.~ref{fig:cg2re}. The top panel shows the CG bias as a function of the 
S{\'e}rsic index measured from the VIS images when we split the sample based on the
observed effective radii (galaxies with $r_{\rm eff}>0\farcs 35$ are classified as `large' 
and the others as `small'). The large galaxies cover a large range of S{\'e}rsic index and have on average a negative average CG bias. Most of small galaxies have small S{\'e}rsic indices ($<2.5$), and
the average bias is positive, with slightly larger values for $n\sim 4$.


%
In the bottom panel, the galaxies are divide into three groups: the
first is red galaxy whose color is large ($m_{V-I}>1.0$); the second
and third group are the rest galaxies either with large Sersic index
($n>2.25$, elliptical galaxy) or small Sersic index (disk galaxy). The
solid lines show the bin average over effective radius.


We can see that the VIS image alone can also provide an rough
estimation for CG bias, but classification of the galaxies is
necessary. As shown in the figure, the disk galaxies have small bias,
small radius ($<1$ arcsec), and also small bias scatters. The
elliptical galaxies cover large radius range, and the bias is larger
than the disk ones. The bias in red galaxies are significant, and
mainly negative. The scatters of red galaxies are larger than the
other two kinds of galaxies.

Extra photometry can definitely provide more constraints on the CG
bias, as it has been shown the correlations between colour gradients and
other properties of galaxy. Moreover, the multi-band
information is required for the photometric redshift study. One can
obtain that for free to calibrate the CG bias. Although the dependence
on the multi-band is different between photometric redshift and CG
bias, the experience from photometric redshift can be used for CG
bias, such as some machine learning algorithms.


We calculate the average bias and the dispersions over the redshift
bins for both red ($m_{V-I}>0.5$) and blue galaxies
(Table\,\ref{table:calibration}). The red galaxies are mainly located
between redshift $(0.4,1.2)$, while the blue galaxies are low density
in redshift $(0.8,1.2)$. The bias from red galaxies are significantly
smaller than that of blue galaxies, as one expected, the colour
gradient in the elliptical galaxies are smaller. The dispersions of
the bias in each bin are large, which probably indicate that in each
bin there are several kinds and sizes of galaxies. Therefore, in
order to calibrate the bias with high precision, one need bigger
galaxy samples. From our simulation, we need about $200$ galaxies for
one type of galaxy in every redshift bin. If we make rough bins, for
instance, 2 types of colour: red and blue; 5 different sizes from
about $0.1$ arcsec to $1.0$ arcsec (Fig.\ref{fig:cg2re}), and 5
redshift bins, at least $20 000$ galaxies are required.  For more
realistic SED classifications and redshift bins, several times larger
sample are also necessary.

\section{Summary and Discussion}
In the image survey for weak gravitational lensing, the wide band
filter can provide high signal-to-noise images and large coverage of
redshift range. There is however a shape bias due to the chromatic
shape of galaxy and the PSF, which is named as colour gradient
bias. For very wide band surveys, such as Euclid, this effect can
cause a non-negligible bias.
%
In this work, we exam such a kind of bias in measuring the shape of a
galaxy using both simulated images and real data taken from the HST
ACS CANDELS survey. In the simulated galaxy images, we confirm the
bias behaviour from previous results (\citetalias{Semboloni13}). We further apply the
calibration method to the noisy images in the simulations, and find
that with reasonable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR$=15$) and sufficient
numbers of galaxies ($300$ images for one type of galaxy in one
redshift bin), we can estimate the CG bias to a high precision.
However, the underestimate cannot be avoided due to strong emission
lines, or the uneven SED of source galaxies. Moreover, the simulations
are performed with only two galaxy models, and the SNR of the
simulated images in two bands are assigned with equal value. In
reality, the relation between the SNR with the size and SED of the
galaxies has to be taken into account.
%
We also perform comparison of TinyTim and star PSF models. The
inaccuracy, especially that due to the binary stars, will cause errors
in estimating the CG bias.


In the estimation using CANDELS data, we select the images from two
filters (F606W, F814W). For most of the galaxy, the bias ($|m|$) is
smaller than $0.01$.  As we find from simulated images, the estimation
using noisy image has a large scatter, thus the CG bias in reality may
be even smaller than that shown here.
%
In our sample of galaxies, the CG bias shows a correlation with the
colour of galaxies, and a linear relation with the ratio of two band
images. We also generate the mock VIS band images. From the parameters
of the image (Sersic index and effective radius), one can classify the
galaxy in order to obtain tighter constraints on the bias. For example,
the galaxies with small Sersic index, i.e. disk-like, have smaller CG
bias. On the other hand, those with large Sersic index have large bias
and also bias variation. The relations show consistent results about
the colour gradient dependence on the properties of galaxy
\citep[e.g.][]{2010MNRAS.407..144T}. However, since the CG bias also
depends on the relative size with respect to the PSF, the dependence
of CG bias is certainly more complicate. We did not provide any
fitting formula for the bias at current sample, since the scatters are
too large. More importantly, it has to be performed according to the
types or morphology of the galaxies, which require larger sample of data.

The multi-band photometry from several bands, which can be used to
estimate the redshift, can be also use for the CG bias analysis.
Although the redshift dependence is not significant in our sample of
galaxies, this may not be the case for a larger survey, or if we look
at the bias according to the type of galaxy. Moreover, the colour of
galaxy also indicates the evolution history, or the large scale tide
force.  It can be also used for the study of intrinsic alignment
analysis in weak lensing \citep[e.g.][]{2015SSRv..193....1J}.
Therefore, the dependence of the CG bias on the colour of the galaxies
will further increase the sysmatics of the intrinsic alignment. The
detail behaviour will require large cosmological simulations, which is
beyond the scope of this paper, but definitely needs further studies for
the project such as Euclid.

The role of environment on the colour gradients is not clear. On the
one hand, it has been shown that colour gradients depend on the
environment where galaxies reside, with steeper colour gradients in
poor rather than rich clusters \citep[e.g.][]{2005ApJ...626L..19L},
which is possible due to the different processes during galaxy
formation. On the other hand, in recent study using integral field
spectra from SDSS-IV, the metallicity gradients show weak or no
correlation with density environment \citep{2017MNRAS.465.4572Z}. In
any cases, close galaxy pairs or nearby bright star(s) may also cause
weak brightness/colour gradient, which will affect our estimate for CG
bias as well. 

In this work, we use the brightness moments to estimate the
ellipticity of the galaxy. The PSF correction is not taken into
account. The bias thus will appear in every method of measurement.
However, the bias using the measurement method for real data
will be different, since every method has its own property and weight
function. The CG bias will have method-dependent properties as well,
although they will in principle have same dependence on the colour
gradient of the galaxy images. As the first step of the CG bias
analysis, we did not adopt any specific method in order to obtain
general properties of the CG bias. Before the real analysis of Euclid
data, one needs to study the bias with specific methods and simulated
images with real properties in the Euclid weak lensing survey.

%
%Moreover, as we point out that higher order image distortions, such as
%flexion may increase the CG bias. It can be seen from our analysis
%using both simulated and CANDELS data. Although the higher order
%effect can be neglected most times, it can still significantly
%increase the CG bias when the source images are located close to the
%strong lensing region. Therefore, such a kind of effect may cause
%significant bias in the strong lensing analysis using wide band
%images. In galaxy-galaxy lensing and cluster lensing, one needs to
%be careful about such higher order effects as well.
