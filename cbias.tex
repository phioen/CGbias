\begin{abstract}
  In weak gravitational lensing, the precision strongly depends on
  the shape measurement of the galaxy images. Observation using wide
  band filter can provide images with high signal-to-noise ratio, and
  can cover a large redshift range as well. However, the shape
  measurement requires analysis of the point spread function
  (PSF). In general, both the PSF and the galaxy are chromatic,
  i.e. the shapes vary with wavelength. Thus, measuring the shape of
  galaxies using integrated images over the filter will cause higher
  order systematic bias, which is called colour gradient bias.
  %
  We perform an estimate of this bias using both simulated images and
  real data from Hubble Space Telescope. We show that the estimation
  for colour gradient bias using two narrow bands can reach a high
  precision in the simulated noisy data. A rough requirement on the
  number of galaxy is given according to the simulations. In the
  analysis using real data, we find correlations between the bias and
  some parameters of the galaxy, which is consistent with the study
  about colour gradients. There is clear bias dependence on the
  colour, size and type of the galaxies. We did not find direct
  dependence on the redshift, which can be improved with larger sample
  of data and applying classification of the galaxies.

%Moreover, we find that the higher order image distortions, such as
%flexion, will enlarge the colour gradient bias in shear, although it
%affects the estimation only when the images are in strong lensing regions.

\section{Introduction}

Weak gravitational lensing has been identified as a powerful method in
cosmology. The images of distant galaxy are distorted by the
gravitational potential generated by the intervening matter, which
does not depend on the nature of matter
\citep[e.g.][]{2001PhR...340..291B}. A statistical analysis of image
distortion of background galaxies provides crucial information about
the mass distribution from the galaxy, cluster to the large scale
structures, and thus put tight constraint to the cosmological models
as well as the dark matter and dark energy
\citep[e.g.][]{2000MNRAS.318..625B, 2000Natur.405..143W,
  2006ApJ...648L.109C, 2008ARNPS..58...99H, 2008A&A...479....9F,
  2010A&A...516A..63S, 2012ApJ...755...56U, cfhtls2013kilbinger,
  2015ApJ...806....4M}.

The precision of measuring the shapes of the galaxy images is limited
due to the atmospheric turbulence, i.e. Point Spread Function
(PSF). Correction due to the PSF is one of the major problem in weak
lensing study \citep[e.g.][]{2012MNRAS.423.3163K}.  The space
telescopes are highly in favor in weak lensing study, since they can
take the advantage of small space PSF, e.g. the future weak lensing
survey loaded on the Euclid satellite \citep{2011arXiv1110.3193L}. The
weak lensing survey by Euclid plans to provide a large sample of
accurate measurements of both shape and photometric redshift for the
galaxies. The filter of the Euclid image survey has a very wide
bandpass ($550nm-920nm$), which covers a large range of redshift of
galaxies and can also obtain galaxy images with high signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR).

In shear measurements, the galaxy shape is corrected using the
effective (integrated) PSF. However, the galaxies in general have
different intrinsic shapes at different wavelengths, as well as the
PSF, e.g. the size of PSF is slightly larger at longer wavelength.
\citep{2015ApJ...807..182M} have also shown that the differential
chromatic refraction can introduce systematics to the measurement of
galaxy shapes. The chromatic PSF causes a bias in the measurement,
which can be estimated and reduced to the required levels using a
colour weighted PSF \citep{2010MNRAS.405..494C}. While the correction
described in \citet{2010MNRAS.405..494C} assumes a spatial uniform spectral
energy distribution (SED) of the source galaxy. It becomes inaccurate
when the SED, or colour of the source galaxy varies spatially. The
effects introduce a higher order systematic bias in measuring the
shape of galaxies, if one uses the integrated images and integrated
PSF. The bias, which we called colour gradient (hereafter CG) bias,
has dependence on several factors: such as the SED of the galaxy, the
relative size of the galaxy to the PSF, as well as the bandwidth of
the filter. The relative magnitude of the CG can be neglected for
narrow band survey. However, the CG bias is expected to be relevant
for Euclid, especially since the error budget of Euclid weak lensing project
is small \citep[e.g.][]{2013MNRAS.431.3103C,2013MNRAS.429..661M}.

In \citep{2012MNRAS.421.1385V, 2013MNRAS.432.2385S}, the simulated
images with Euclid features are used to study the CG bias. A potential
bias of level $10^{-3}$ is found for typical size galaxies even with a
smooth SED, i.e. $\sim1$ arcsec without strong emission or absorption
lines. Moreover, it has been shown from simulations that using two
high resolution narrow band, noise free images, one can calibrate the
CG bias for the regular bulge and disk galaxy with high precision.  In
this work, we will demonstrate the result and the method in
\citet{2013MNRAS.432.2385S}(ES13 in the rest of this paper), and apply
the calibration method to the simulated noisy images.
%The method requires that the match of the bandwidth. Fortunately, the
%bandwidth of weak lensing survey on Euclid can be cover by two filters
%on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), i.e., F606W and F814W.

The colour gradients in the galaxy have been widely studied as it is
a tool to discriminate the galaxy formation and evolution scenarios,
e.g. inside-out growth through gas accretion or major mergers, will
cause distinct morphologies as well as colour gradients
\citep[e.g.][]{2010MNRAS.407..144T}. The observational picture is
complex, and different correlations with galaxy properties have been
reached. For example, it has been found that the negative colour
gradients (redder in the centre and bluer in the outskirts) exist in
the elliptical galaxies, and steeper colour gradients are more
commonly found in bluer or more luminous early type galaxy
\citep[e.g.][]{2011MNRAS.414.3052D,2011MNRAS.411.1151G}.
\citet[][]{2010AJ....140.1528L, 2016A&A...593A..84K} also suggest
correlations between colour gradients and the overall colour and
luminosity of the galaxies. Moreover, all the previous study focus on
the galaxies at low redshift. A large part of the source galaxies in
weak lensing locate at high redshift. All the complexity makes the
calibration of CG bias more difficult and requires detail study
specially on the galaxy morphology.

In Section 2, we will introduce the basic concept of gravitational
lensing and CG bias. The simulated images are presented to study the
bias, following the similar method in ES13. In Section 4 we will apply
the calibration method to a galaxy sample selected from HST CANDELS
data (Schrabback et al. in prep.) and give our discussion and
conclusion in the end.


%%%%%
\section{Basic formulism}
We introduce the basic symbols and parameters that will be used in
this paper. We use angular coordinate $\theta$ on the lens plane, and
$\gamma=\gamma_1 + \ii \gamma_2$ is the complex lensing shear. We
consider an image of a galaxy, and denote the photon brightness
distribution of the image at each wavelength $\lambda$ by
$I(\theta,\lambda)$, which is related to the intensity
$S(\theta,\lambda)$ by $I(\theta,\lambda)=\lambda S(\theta,\lambda)$.
Due to the PSF $P(\theta,\lambda)$ and filter of the telescope
$F(\lambda)$, the image of a galaxy observed with a filter of width
$\Delta \lambda$ is given by
%
\be
I^{obs}(\theta) = \int_{\Delta\lambda} I(\theta, \lambda) *  P(\theta,\lambda)
\, F(\lambda)\d \lambda,
\elabel{iobs}
\ee
%
where $*$ denotes a convolution. In the weak lensing regime, the
shear can be estimated from the ellipticity of the source galaxy,
which is usually a measurement of second order brightness moments
$Q_{ij}$ \citep{2001PhR...340..291B}
%
\be
e_1+\ii e_2 \approx
{Q_{11} - Q_{22} + 2 \ii Q_{12} \over Q_{11} + Q_{22} +2(Q_{11}Q_{22} - Q_{12}^2)^{1/2} },
\elabel{mshear}
\ee
%
where the second order brightness moments are given by
%
\be
Q_{ij} = {1 \over S_0} \int  I^{obs}(\theta)\, \theta_i \theta_j \, W(\theta)\; \d^2 \theta \quad\; (i,j=1,2),
\ee
%
where $S_0=\int \d^2\theta W(\theta) I^{obs}(\theta)$ is the total observed
brightness, and $W(\theta)$ is the weight function. The moment-based
methods, such as KSB \citep{1995ApJ...449..460K} or DEIMOS
\citep{2011MNRAS.412.1552M} will be biased due to the weight function,
which causes dependence of the CG bias to the properties of weight
function. In this paper, we will limit the method to the brightness
moments, and use the circular Gaussian weighting function with the
size of half light radius.

The CG bias is estimated from following steps: we first generate the
image in every wavelength from the galaxy model. Then we shear the
images, and apply the convolution with PSF before integrating over the
wavelength. Since both the galaxy and the PSF are chromatic, the
integrated image contains CG bias. We also need a flat SED image,
which contains non-colour gradient (NCG), and is the ideal image for
shear measurement. The NCG images can be generated by
%
\be
I^{\rm NCG}(k, \lambda_{\rm ref}) = \dfrac{F(\lambda_{\rm ref}) I^{obs}(k)}
{P_{\rm eff}},
\ee
%
where $I^{obs}(k)$ is the galaxy image (Eq.\ref{eq:iobs}) in Fourier space.
The deconvolution is performed with the effective PSF
%
\be
P_{\rm eff}(\theta) = \int \d \lambda\, P(\theta,\lambda) F(\lambda),
\ee
%
%where we assume that the PSF has the same SED of the galaxy.
which is the PSF integrated over the filer band.  The NCG images are
the uniform image over the wavelength. One can see
Fig. \ref{fig:flowchart} for the steps of generating the CG and NCG
images. In reality, the only difference is that if the lensing process
is behind the PSF convolution.  We need to emphasize here that the
image pair we generated to estimate the CG bias are independent of the
measurement method. The bias we will present later are based on the
moment method. As we will shown in the appendix, in the moment method,
if we convolve the two images with the same PSF, the ratio of the
ellipticity from two images does not change significantly.
%
Comparing the ellipticity (shear) measured from the two images we will
have the multiplicative CG bias \citep{2006MNRAS.368.1323H}
%
\be
m= {e_i^{CG} \over e_i^{NCG} }-1,
\ee
%
where $e_i$ refers to the measurement of the first or second component
of the ellipticity. In principle, the two components $e_1$ or $e_2$
will give the same estimation of the CG bias. Due to the intrinsic
shape of the galaxy images, the two components may have a different
response, which can be avoided by rotating the galaxy images.  In this
work, we will use one ellipticity component $e_1^{CG}/e_1^{NCG}-1$ as
our estimate if not specified. The additive bias can be detected by
correlating the estimated shear and will not be considered here.

\section{Colour gradient bias in simulated data}

The CG bias is a higher order systematic bias, the numerical noise in
simulated images may cause extra error in our analysis. Thus, we first
adopt two independent codes to generate the simulated images: one is C/C++
and the other is python-based GalSim package
\citep{2015A&amp;C....10..121R}. In the C code, we directly calculate
the brightness density at the centre of each pixel, and sample the
image using the approximate brightness in each pixel (brightness at
the centre multiply the area of pixel). In GalSim the image are sampled
by FFT rendering.
%
The simulated images are checked for numerical errors, no significant
problems are found in neither C or GalSim. Since the deconvolution is
particularly difficult in the numerical calculation, we also perform
that for the elliptical images. A small relative error $\sim10^{-6}$
appears in ellipticity using both C and GalSim, which is two orders of
magnitude smaller than the possible CG bias, and can be neglect in
this study.

We apply the two same galaxy models as in ES13. It will allow us to
further check the numerical error, since in ES13 the images are
simulated by different code. The images are consist of two components:
bulge and disk, both are modeled by a Sersic profile with index $n$
%
\be
I_{\rm Sersic}(\theta) = I_0 {\rm e}^{-\kappa\; \theta^{1/n}},
\ee
%
where $I_0$ is the central intensity, and $\kappa=1.9992\,n -
0.3271$.  For the SED of the bulge and the disk we use the galaxy
templates from \citet{1980ApJS...43..393C}. The SED of the bulge is
modeled by an elliptical galaxy, and SED of irregular galaxy for the
disk. We choose an extremely blue SED for disk to generate large
colour gradient in the galaxy images. For each wavelength, we
construct the galaxy image $I(\theta,\lambda)$ by adding up the
profiles of bulge and disk normalised by fixing the ratio
$S_{bulge}/S_{disk}$ at $\lambda=550$nm. The integrated profile is
applied to the Euclid filter in a wavelength range $[550:\,920]$nm
with a step of $1$nm. The images are constructed in an isolated stamp
with size $256\times256$ pixels, and resolution $0.05$ arcsec/pixel
(Table \ref{table:galaxy model}).

We use different reference PSF models. The first one is a Gaussian profile,
with wavelength dependent width:
%
\be
\sigma_{psf}(\lambda) = w_{0,800}\rund{\lambda \over 800{\rm nm}},
\elabel{psf}
\ee
%
where $w_{0,800}$ is the width of the PSF at $800$nm. In this section
we use $w_{0,800}=0.102$ arcsec, which is the same as in ES13. The
other reference model is an Airy function, which is close to the
Design profile \citep{2011arXiv1110.3193L}
%
\be
P(\theta) = {I_0 \over (1-\epsilon^2)^2} \rund{{2J_1(x)\over x} - {2\epsilon J_1(\epsilon x) \over x}}^2,
\elabel{psfairy}
\ee
%
where $I_0$ is the maximum intensity at the center, $\epsilon$ is the
aperture obscuration ratio, and $J_1(x)$ is the first kind of Bessel
function of order one. $x$ is defined as $x=\pi \theta/l$, where
$l=\lambda/D$ is wavelength over diameter ($\epsilon=1/3,\; D=1.2$ for
Euclid). In Fig.\,\ref{fig:psfmodel}, we compare the Airy model with
other PSF models.

We measure the CG bias as a function of weight size
(Fig.\ref{fig:biasofweight}). The solid lines are the results from
ES13, and the dashed (dotted) lines are the results using C (GalSim)
code. The blue and green lines are the CG bias of small size galaxy
(S-galaxy), while the red and purple lines are that of big size galaxy
(B-galaxy). One can see that the CG bias from all three different
simulated galaxies are consistent, i.e. the numerical error does not
introduce significant bias in this study. Thus, in the following of
this section, we will only use the GalSim to generate the mock
galaxies.
%
The CG bias decreases with the increasing weight size.  As the optimal
choice to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio is to match the weight
function to the size of the source galaxy, we will use the half light
radius for the weight function in the following of this paper. For the
two mock galaxies, the CG bias with such a weight function is
$0.8\times10^{-3}, 2\times10^{-3}$ for B- and S-galaxy respectively.
The smaller size galaxies have a larger CG bias, which suggests that
the calibration of the CG bias need to take into account of the size
as well as the real colour gradient of the galaxy.
%(the reason for the small divergence of blue lines is that the
%parameters used for simulating galaxy are slightly different).

Besides shear, there are higher order image distortions in weak lensing,
such as flexion \citep[e.g.][]{2002ApJ...564...65G,bacon2006}. In
previous analysis, we only consider the shear effect in the lensing
process, while the higher order image distortions also suffer from CG
bias as well. In additional tests, we perform the complete lens
ray-tracing instead of solely shearing the images. (We only use our C
code in this part, since the current version of GalSim only provides
shear effect.) We adopt an Singular Isothermal Sphere halo model as
the lens model, and vary the configuration within some reasonable
range, such as the Einstein radius, and the separation between the
lens and the source image (the corresponding shear value varies
between about $[0.02, 0.1]$). We find that the variation of lensing
magnitude can cause different CG bias (yellow shadow in
Fig.\ref{fig:biasofweight}), and in most time the flexion effect will
increase the CG bias. Such effects do not appear if we solely shear
the images. However in general case, the cosmic shear has a value
about a few percents. We can see that from the bottom boundary of the
yellow shadow, the bias are almost the same as that only considering
the shear effect. Only in case of the galaxy cluster lensing,
galaxy-galaxy lensing, especially in the strong lensing region, when
the flexion becomes significant, one has to take into account of such
kind of effect.

\subsection{Calibration of CG bias using simulated HST images}

We outline the method that calibrate the CG bias using two bands
images, while the details can be found in ES13. We will use two narrow
band images to reconstruct the image at each wavelength. For each of
the narrow filter the image can be approximated by:
%
\be
I_i(\theta) = \int_{\Delta \lambda_i} T_i(\lambda)\, I(\theta,\lambda) \;\d \lambda,
\elabel{linearitp}
\ee
%
where $T(\lambda)$ is the transmission, and $i=1,2$ stand for the two bands.
We assume that for each pixel the image can be interpolated linearly:
%
\be
I(\theta,\lambda) \approx
I_{\rm inter}(\theta,\lambda)=a(\theta)\lambda + b(\theta).
\elabel{interpolate}
\ee
%
Eqs.\ref{eq:linearitp} and \ref{eq:interpolate} yield a linear set of
equations on each pixel, which can be used to solved for the
coefficients $(a,b)$:
%
\be
T_{ai} \lambda a(\theta) \,+\,T_{bi} b(\theta) = I_i(\theta), \quad\; i=1,2,
\elabel{lineareq}
\ee
%
where $T_{ai,\,bi}$ is the integrated transmission function at two
filters. With $(a,b)$ and Eq.\ref{eq:interpolate}, one can obtain
approximated galaxy images of each wavelength
$I(\theta,\lambda)$. Then we will follow the same procedure as in
previous section to estimate the CG bias.

The same two galaxy models from previous section are used in the
simulation, and we simulate the images in two HST filters: F606W,
F814W, which cover the filter of Euclid image survey. The spectra of
the galaxy are shifted according to their redshift, but the evolution
of the galaxy or the cosmology are not adopted in the simulation. The
spatial resolution is $0.05$ arcsec/pixel. The PSF is modeled by the
Airy function with diameter $D=2.5$ and obscuration $0.33$, which is
the configuration of HST. As shown in ES13, one needs to correct the
PSF effect in the observed images, or the CG bias will be
underestimated. We will adopt the same step: deconvolution for images
before the bias estimation and discuss that for the noisy images
later.

In order to see the effect of noise in the galaxy image, we add
Gaussian noise into the simulated HST images. An ideal level (SNR=50)
and a moderate level (SNR=15) are used to see the effect of the CG
bias. The RMS of the Gaussian image noise is determined by the total
flux ($F_{tot}$) within a certain radius $1.5\,r_h$
%
\be
\sigma = {F_{tot} \over {\rm SNR} \sqrt{N_{tot}} },
\ee
%
where $N_{tot}$ is the total pixel number within $1.5\,r_h$.  In
Fig.\ref{fig:ests2n}, we compare the input SNR with that estimated by
SExtractor \citep{1996A&AS..117..393B}. We can see that the
estimations are slightly higher than the input values at $SNR=15$, but
still within a reasonable value for real weak lensing survey.

Direct devonvolution of a noisy image will end with a strange galaxy
image and large numerical noise, thus we apply Galfit
\citep{2010AJ....139.2097P} to fit the noisy image, and use the fitted
image as our noise reduced observed image, i.e. the residual noise is
not taken into account for CG analysis. For the necessary fitting
profile and number of components, we also use two Sersic components as
bulge and disk for both image bands. For each image, we apply further
constraints to the galaxy parameters: Sersic index, effective radius,
and axis ratio (Table \ref{fitpar}).
%the effective radius can be achieved at a small variations (within
%$20\%$), while the Sersic index usually has a large difference from
%the input values as well as scatter.

In order to provide a initial parameters for Galfit, we use the
stacked image of two bands to estimate the center and some initial
values of the galaxy parameters from SExtractor. The fitting images
slightly depend on the initial values, and can change the estimate for
the CG bias estimation. The dependence will become significant with
the decreasing of image SNR. In the following estimation for the CG
bias, we will perform the image fitting using two kinds of initial
parameters: in the first one we will leave all the fitting parameters
free; while in the other one we will freeze the Sersic index as the
simulated value, and leave the others free. As we will present,
with sufficient large samples, the estimation using noisy images for the
CG bias can converge, and is independent of the initial parameters.

Applying the calibration method to the fitted images, we can obtain
the estimation of the CG bias for the simulated images. In
Figs.\ref{fig:biasofz50} and \ref{fig:biasofz15}, we show the shear CG
bias with redshift. In each panel, we show different estimates for the
bias:
\begin{itemize}
\item
The black solid lines are the ``True'' CG bias: we use the true
SED of the galaxy and images of each wavelength to estimate the bias
without approximation.
\item
The dashed lines are the estimation using two
HST images without noise.
\item
The colour lines are those using noisy images. The difference between
red and blue lines are in the image fitting: for the red lines, we
free all the parameters in image fitting, for blue lines we fix the
Sersic index as the input value. For the orange lines we also free all
the parameters, but we perform another convolution with the effective
PSF (see appendix for more detail). In Fig.\ref{fig:flowchart} one can
see that the convolution is canceled with the last deconvolution for
the CG images.  The reason for that is the deconvolution may cause
some numerical errors, especially for the small size noisy images. The
extra PSF convolution will not significantly change the CG bias as we
will show in the appendix. Therefore, in the following result for
noise images, we will perform the convolution to the NCG image instead
of deconvolution to the CG one.
\end{itemize}
Moreover, although we use the circular source image in the simulation,
the fitted noisy images will become slightly elliptical. In order to
get rid of the error due to the ``intrinsic shape'', we rotate the
source image $6$ times, and use the average value as our estimate for
the galaxy ellipticity \citep{2007AJ....133.1763N}. At each redshift,
we use one noise free image and $40 (200, 300)$ noisy images for $SNR=50
(SNR=15)$.  In the bottom panel of each figure, we also show the
residues with respect to the true CG bias, and the error bars, which
are given by the standard deviation from $e_{cg}$ and $e_{ncg}$
%
\be
\sigma_m= |m| \sqrt{\rund{\sigma_{cg} \over \langle e_{cg}\rangle }^2
  + \rund{\sigma_{ncg} \over \langle e_{ncg} \rangle}^2 }.
\elabel{sigmam}

In the error panel, the grey shadow stands for the error budget of CG
bias in Euclid cosmic shear analysis \citep[$\pm
  0.00025$][]{2013MNRAS.431.3103C,2013MNRAS.429..661M}.

One can see that in general our estimate can reproduce the properties
of CG bias in ellipticity measurement using both ideal or noisy
images.  In the high SNR cases (Fig.\ref{fig:biasofz50}), all the
estimates with different initial parameters basically agree with each
other. The estimate with all fitting parameters free gives lower bias
than that fixed the Sersic index. In the low SNR case
(Fig.\ref{fig:biasofz15}), the fitting using all free parameters show
better estimates for the CG bias, and the residual are within the
requirement for most cases. The variance due to the image fitting with
different initial parameters are larger than high SNR cases, but can
still be reduced by large sample of images and reach the requirement.
It means that for each single type of galaxy, one need about $300$
galaxy images in order to calibrate the bias. The scatters in the
estimation are proportional to the magnitude of the bias, i.e. we have
large uncertainty for S-galaxy at low redshift.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% PSF corrections
In additional tests using other measurement methods for PSF
correction, such as the image fitting methods
\citep[e.g.][]{2007MNRAS.382..315M,2008MNRAS.390..149K,2013MNRAS.429.2858M},
and KSB+ \citep[e.g.][]{1998ApJ...504..636H,2006MNRAS.368.1323H}, we
find that the bias has similar dependence on the SED of the galaxies,
although the magnitudes are different.

In both two figures, we notice that at $z=0.5$ and $0.9$, the estimates are
significantly smaller than the true bias for both galaxy models. This is
due to the uneven SED of the source galaxy in the two HST filter. In
Fig.\ref{fig:sedz}, we compare the SED of the galaxy in redshift
$z=0,0.5$. One can see that at $z=0.5$, besides the strong emission
lines, the linear approximation cannot reflect the properties of the
source galaxies. Thus for some galaxies with complex properties, two band
image may not be sufficient to calibrate the CG bias.
%In Fig.\ref{fig:err2snr}, we show the average residual bias
%$\bar{|m|}$ over the redshift as a function of SNR of the images. For
%each SNR, we average the residual in redshift range from $0$ to $1.2$,
%and for each redshift, $50$ noise realizations are used. One can see
%that for the images with SNR smaller than $\sim10$, the errors of our
%estimate will be non negligible, and the estimation thus cannot
%provide trustable calibration. Another simplification that we adopt
%here is that the SNR we used in two bands are the same. This is in
%reality not the case in most the time. In the more sophisticated
%simulation, the image SNR of two bands need to be determined by the
%colour of the galaxy.

\subsection{PSF variations in calibration data from HST}

In the previous test, we used an ideal circular symmetric Airy PSF
model. It may however cause inaccuracy in our estimation of the CG
bias. Thus, we perform additional tests due to the variations of the
PSF. The noise free images are used in order to isolate the effects of
the PSF. The different PSF models are applied only in the step of
deconvolution for the simulated HST images.

First we generate three pairs of PSF model by slightly increasing the
size of PSF. The
effect on the CG bias is shown in Fig.\ref{fig:psfacc1}. From solid,
dashed to dotted lines, we increased the PSF size of the F606 bands; while
from red, green to blue lines, we increase the PSF size of the F814
bands. Although the effect due to the two PSF variations depends on the
SED of the source galaxy, one can see that increasing the size of the
PSF in different bands will cause either on increase or
decrease in the CG bias calibration. Once again, we can see that
the small galaxies are more sensitive to the variation of PSF.

Moreover, we generate 3 different PSF models using TinyTim
\citep{2011SPIE.8127E..0JK}: the first one is a normal PSF without
defocus, the second one is a bit larger but still realistic PSF, which
is generated by changing the parameter defocus offset of secondary
mirror to the primary, the third one is simply transposing of the
first one.  In Fig.\ref{fig:psfacc2}, we do not find significant
effects with slight variations on the PSF. This may be because we used
the circular symmetric, noise free images in the tests. For real
galaxy noisy images, the PSF may cause slightly stronger effects. In
additional tests, we calculate circular averages of the three PSF
models, and find slightly different CG bias when using the second
model PSF, since it has slightly larger size. Thus, the limited
accuracy of the PSF model in HST data
will not be an important source of error in our study.

\section{CANDELS data}

\subsection{Calibration sample}
In this section, we use the real galaxy images to estimate the CG bias
which will appear in the Euclid weak lensing survey. For the reference
PSF, we use the Airy model (Eq.\,\ref{eq:psfairy}).


To investigate the impact of colour gradients using realistic galaxies
populations, we employ HST/ACS data taken in the F606W and F814W
filters in the three CANDELS fields (AEGIS, COSMOS, and UDS), which have
a roughly homogeneous coverage in both bands
\citep[see][]{davis2007,grogin2011,koekemoer11}. We base our analysis
on a tile-wise reduction of the ACS data, incorporating pointings
which have at least four exposures to facilitate good cosmic ray
removal, yielding combined exposure times of 1.3-2.3ks in F606W and
2.1-3.0ks in F814W.  We employ the updated correction for
charge-transfer inefficiency from \cite{massey2014},
\texttt{MultiDrizzle} \citep{koekemoer2003} for the cosmic ray removal
and stacking, as well as careful shift refinement, optimised
weighting, and masking for stars and image artifacts as detailed in
\cite{schrabback2010}.  Schrabback et al. (in prep.) describe the
generation of weak lensing catalogues for these images.  We base our
analysis on the galaxies passing their source selection and apply
additional magnitude cuts as detailed below. To investigate the
dependence of the colour gradient influence on galaxy colour and
redshift, we match this galaxy catalogue to the photometric redshift
catalogue from \cite{skelton14}.  We list the total non-masked areas
in which these catalogues overlap in Table \ref{table:mag}.


We match the galaxy from V(F606W) and I(F814W) bands by selecting that
the difference of galaxy coordinates in two bands is smaller than 1
pixel ($0.05$ arcsec). Moreover, in order to resemble the Euclid image
survey, we apply selection based on the magnitude of two bands. In the
first selection, the galaxy must be brighter than magnitude $25$ in
V-band and $24.5$ in I-band. In the second selection (VIS, N2 sample),
we apply the linear interpolation from V and I band using the
effective wavelength to approximate the Euclid VIS magnitude, and
select the galaxy brighter than $24.5$ in VIS. In the last one (N3
sample), we enlarge the sample by using lower threshold in two bands:
$25.5$ in V and $25.0$ in I band. The amount of galaxies is listed in
Table\ref{table:mag}.
%
The galaxy VIS magnitudes will determined by several factors, such as
exposure time and filter transmission, etc. Thus, the actual number of
galaxies can be different from what we have shown in this work. The
approximation that we use rely on the flatness of the source
spectrum. In the VIS sample, the number of galaxies is similar to that in
the first selection in all three fields, which suggest that the
spectra of our galaxies are relatively smooth. In the N3 sample the galaxy
number is much higher.
%
The total galaxy number and number density ($\sim$12/arcmin$^2$) is
lower than that in ES13 for several reasons: the galaxies are selected
which the 3D-HST photometric redshift are available, and those
suitable for weak lensing analysis, e.g. the very big or bright
galaxies are not include. Moreover, in ES13 the galaxies are selected
by the magnitude of F814W. However we select galaxies by the estimated
VIS magnitude and well match in F606W and F814W.

There is no significant difference found in the distribution of galaxy
parameters, such as effective radius, axis ratio, photometric redshift
and colour (we use $m_{F606}-m_{F814}$ as colour in this work, and
will write as $m_{V-I}$ later). The SNR of most images in VIS sample
are larger than $15$, thus they will be able to provide relatively
stable estimate for CG bias.
%while the low SNR images may suffer from large uncertainty of bias estimation. Thus we only show the result in the VIS sample.

We also compare the galaxies from 3 catalogues (AEIGS, COSMOS, UDS).  In
the distribution of galaxy parameters (Fig.\ref{fig:datapro1}), we
find no significant difference in half light radius ($r_h$), galaxy
axis ratio or redshift distribution. However, in the colour
distribution, there are more blue galaxies (small $m_{V-I}$) in AEGIS,
which is more significant in N3 sample. We will see later that the
colour of galaxy is also related to the CG bias in shape measurement.
%There is slight difference in the SNR of two filters: the SNR of galaxies in AEGIS are larger than the other two in V-band, while smaller in I-band.

\subsection{CG bias from CANDELS}
We estimate the CG bias following the same procedure for the simulated galaxy:
\begin{itemize}
  \item
    fit the galaxy using one Sersic component for both band
    images. Some constraints such as Sersic index ($0.5<n<5.0$),
    effective radius ($1<r_e<50$ pixel) and axis ratio ($0.6<q<1.0$)
    are adopted in Galfit.
  \item
    interpolate the SED on each pixel of the galaxy image, and
    generate the galaxy at each wavelength (Eq.\ref{eq:linearitp} -
    \ref{eq:lineareq}), and then integrate over the wavelength to
    simulate the CG and NCG galaxy image.
  \item
    measure the shape of two images and calculate the bias $m$. We
    also apply $6$ different orientation of the images in order
    to reduce the intrinsic shape noise.
\end{itemize}
%
In Fig.\ref{fig:cgbhis}, we show the histogram of the CG bias. The CG
bias in most of the galaxies is smaller than $0.01$ ($94\%$). We did
not perform averaging as we did for the simulated noisy images, which
can further reduce the scatter of the bias. Thus the actual bias,
especially the scatter in the sample, is smaller. In the bottom
panel, we estimate the CG bias using a larger weight function
($2r_h$). As one expected, the bias decreases by about one order of
magnitude.

Three PSF models from TinyTim, which are the same as in the previous
section, are used in the deconvolution of CANDELS data. There is small
difference among the three since the three PSF models have similar
size. The following results are shown using the first PSF model from
TinyTim.
%
%The red line show the CG bias if we perform lensing instead of shearing
%the images. We can see that the bias becomes larger, and the effect is
%stronger than the PSF variations. However, it is highly possible that we
%overestimate the flexion and the effect due to that, since we did not
%consider the real lens property. In the rest, we only show the result using
%shearing.

%
The colour gradients as a tracer of galaxy evolution have been found
to be correlate with some aspects. We try to explore relations between
CG bias and the properties of galaxy. First we show the relation
between CG bias with two tracers of the colour gradients: the ratio of
Sersic index from two bands, and the ratio of effective radius from
two bands (Fig. \ref{fig:cg2fitpar}). One can see that there is a
linear relation between the bias and the radius, but for that of
Sersic index it is not obvious. The reason is that the Sersic index is
mainly account for the type of the galaxy, the radius correlates with
the colour gradient directly. Moreover, the CG bias depends on several
factors of the galaxy, e.g. the total size of the galaxy. It is not
surprise to see large bias scatters for the whole sample. In
principle, one expect that when $r_{e606}=r_{e814}$ and
$n_{606}=n_{814}$, the CG bias in principle will be vanish, since the
identical images from two bands will not have a colour gradient. This
is confirmed in our result: the blue line (bin average) in
Fig. \ref{fig:cg2fitpar} meets zero at $r_{e814}/r_{e606}=1$. However,
those colour gradients information will not be available in Euclid. We
also need the relation between the bias with other parameters.


In Fig.\ref{fig:cgbhis}, the galaxies in AEGIS field have more
positive CG bias than the galaxies in the other two. The colour
distribution in AEGIS is different from the other two as well, which
suggests the correlation between the CG bias and the colour of the
galaxy. In Fig.\ref{fig:cg2color}, we show the relation between the CG
bias and the colour of the galaxies. The bias is inversely
proportional to the colour of the galaxies. This is consistent with
the trend of total colour \citep[e.g.][]{2010MNRAS.407..144T}: the
bluer galaxies have positive colour gradients, while the redder ones
have negative gradients. Since this marks a possible transition of two
types of galaxies, we split the galaxy sample into two groups
according to their colour: the red galaxies ($m_{V-I}>0.5$) and the
blue ones ($m_{V-I}<0.5$). They are shown in the bottom panel of
Fig.\ref{fig:cg2color} as a function of redshift. Most of the red
galaxies are located at moderate redshifts, mainly between redshift
$[0.5,1.0]$, while the blue galaxies are either at the lower redshift
($z<0.5$) or higher redshift ($z>1.0$). The CG bias in red galaxies
are obviously more negative than that of the blue ones. It again
confirms that the colour/colour gradients is an important tracer of
the galaxy evolution, since apparently galaxies at different redshift
proceed at different stages of the evolution.

In addition, we stack the images from two bands as our mock VIS band
images, together with the mock VIS magnitude ($m_{VIS}$).  In
Fig.\ref{fig:cg2magvis}, we show the bias as a function of
$m_{VIS}$. There is no obvious dependence on $m_{VIS}$, which seems
conflict with some study of colour gradients,
e.g. \citet{2010MNRAS.407..144T} find tight relation between colour
gradients and $r$-band magnitude. However, there are two points one
needs to notice: 1) the actual $m_{VIS}$ is different from our linear
approximation, also the filter transmission are different of two
telescope. 2) the more important thing is that the wide band magnitude
may not contain sufficient information about the type or colour of
galaxy, thus may not be a good tracer for CG bias.

The VIS image, on the other hand, contains more information
Fig.\ref{fig:cg2re} shows the CG bias with the Sersic index
and the effective radius fitted from the VIS images. In the top panel,
we divide the sample into two groups by the fitted effective radius,
either larger or smaller than $0.35$ arcsec. The small (large)
galaxies are shown by the blue (orange) points, and the blue (red)
line is the bin average.  The large galaxies cover a large range of
Sersic index, have negative average CG bias. Most of small galaxies
have small Sersic index ($<2.5$). The bias of small galaxies are
positive and approximately proportional to the Sersic index. The
scatters of the bias for both large and small galaxies increase with
the Sersic index.
%
In the bottom panel, the galaxies are divide into three groups: the
first is red galaxy whose color is large ($m_{V-I}>1.0$); the second
and third group are the rest galaxies either with large Sersic index
($n>2.25$, elliptical galaxy) or small Sersic index (disk galaxy). The
solid lines show the bin average over effective radius.

%galaxies have relatively smaller size and smaller CG bias, while the

%radius.
%
We can see that the VIS image alone can also provide an rough
estimation for CG bias, but classification of the galaxies is
necessary. As shown in the figure, the disk galaxies have small bias,
small radius ($<1$ arcsec), and also small bias scatters. The
elliptical galaxies cover large radius range, and the bias is larger
than the disk ones. The bias in red galaxies are significant, and
mainly negative. The scatters of red galaxies are larger than the
other two kinds of galaxies.
%
Extra photometry can definitely provide more constraints on the CG
bias, as it has been shown the correlations between colour gradients and
other properties of galaxy. Moreover, the multi-band
information is required for the photometric redshift study. One can
obtain that for free to calibrate the CG bias. Although the dependence
on the multi-band is different between photometric redshift and CG
bias, the experience from photometric redshift can be used for CG
bias, such as some machine learning algorithms.


We calculate the average bias and the dispersions over the redshift
bins for both red ($m_{V-I}>0.5$) and blue galaxies
(Table\,\ref{table:calibration}). The red galaxies are mainly located
between redshift $(0.4,1.2)$, while the blue galaxies are low density
in redshift $(0.8,1.2)$. The bias from red galaxies are significantly
smaller than that of blue galaxies, as one expected, the colour
gradient in the elliptical galaxies are smaller. The dispersions of
the bias in each bin are large, which probably indicate that in each
bin there are several kinds and sizes of galaxies. Therefore, in
order to calibrate the bias with high precision, one need bigger
galaxy samples. From our simulation, we need about $200$ galaxies for
one type of galaxy in every redshift bin. If we make rough bins, for
instance, 2 types of colour: red and blue; 5 different sizes from
about $0.1$ arcsec to $1.0$ arcsec (Fig.\ref{fig:cg2re}), and 5
redshift bins, at least $20 000$ galaxies are required.  For more
realistic SED classifications and redshift bins, several times larger
sample are also necessary.

\section{Summary and Discussion}
In the image survey for weak gravitational lensing, the wide band
filter can provide high signal-to-noise images and large coverage of
redshift range. There is however a shape bias due to the chromatic
shape of galaxy and the PSF, which is named as colour gradient
bias. For very wide band surveys, such as Euclid, this effect can
cause a non-negligible bias.
%
In this work, we exam such a kind of bias in measuring the shape of a
galaxy using both simulated images and real data taken from the HST
ACS CANDELS survey.  In the simulated galaxy images, we confirm the
bias behaviour from previous results (ES13). We further apply the
calibration method to the noisy images in the simulations, and find
that with reasonable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR$=15$) and sufficient
numbers of galaxies ($300$ images for one type of galaxy in one
redshift bin), we can estimate the CG bias to a high
precision. However, the underestimate cannot be avoided due to strong
emission lines, or the uneven SED of source galaxies. Moreover, the
SNR of the simulated images in two bands are assumed to be the
same. In reality, the signal-to-noise in different bands are
correlated to the SED of the galaxies.

We also apply the calibration method to the galaxy images taken by HST
in two filters (F606W, F814W). In the estimation using CANDELS data,
we find that most of the CG bias ($|m|$) is smaller than $0.01$.  As
we find from simulated images, the estimation using noisy image has a
large scatter, thus the CG bias in reality may be smaller than that
shown here.
%
In our sample of galaxies, the CG bias shows a correlation with the
colour of galaxies, and a linear relation with the ratio of two band
images. We also generate the mock VIS band images. From the parameters
of the image (Sersic index and effective radius), one can classify the
galaxy in order to obtain tighter constraints on the bias. For example,
the galaxies with small Sersic index, i.e. disk-like, have smaller CG
bias. On the other hand, those with large Sersic index have large bias
and also bias variation. The relations show consistent results about
the colour gradient dependence on the properties of galaxy
\citep[e.g.][]{2010MNRAS.407..144T}. However, since the CG bias also
depends on the relative size with respect to the PSF, the dependence
of CG bias is certainly more complicate. We did not provide any
fitting formula for the bias at current sample, since the scatters are
too large. More importantly, it has to be performed according to the
types or morphology of the galaxies, which require larger sample of data.

The multi-band photometry from several bands, which can be used to
estimate the redshift, can be also use for the CG bias analysis.
Although the redshift dependence is not significant in our sample of
galaxies, this may not be the case for a larger survey, or if we look
at the bias according to the type of galaxy. Moreover, the colour also
indicates the evolution of galaxy and large scale tide force. It can
be used for the study of intrinsic alignment analysis in weak
lensing. Therefore, a potential correlation between the CG bias and
the intrinsic alignment bias also exists, which requires further
detail study as well.


It has been shown that colour gradients depend on the environment
where galaxies reside, with steeper colour gradients in poor rather
than rich clusters \citep[e.g.][]{2005ApJ...626L..19L}, which is
possible due to the different processes during galaxy formation. Close
galaxy pairs or nearby bright star(s) will also cause weak
brightness/colour gradient, which may affect our estimate for CG bias
as well. Moreover, in the calibration we linearly interpolate the SED
on pixels from two bands. Some advanced method to estimate the SED
\citep[e.g.][]{2016A&A...589A...2J} may help to improve the
calibration of the bias.

In this work, we use the brightness moments to estimate the
ellipticity of the galaxy. The PSF correction is not taken into
account. The bias thus will appear in any method of measurement.
However, the bias using the measurement method for real data
will be different, since every method has its own property and weight
function. The CG bias will have method-dependent properties as well,
although they will in principle have same dependence on the colour
gradient of the galaxy images. As the first step of the CG bias
analysis, we did not adopt any specific method in order to obtain
general properties of the CG bias. Before the real analysis of Euclid
data, one needs to study the bias with specific methods and simulated
images with real properties in the Euclid weak lensing survey.

%
%Moreover, as we point out that higher order image distortions, such as
%flexion may increase the CG bias. It can be seen from our analysis
%using both simulated and CANDELS data. Although the higher order
%effect can be neglected most times, it can still significantly
%increase the CG bias when the source images are located close to the
%strong lensing region. Therefore, such a kind of effect may cause
%significant bias in the strong lensing analysis using wide band
%images. In galaxy-galaxy lensing and cluster lensing, one needs to
%be careful about such higher order effects as well.

\section{Ratio of Moment vs. PSF convolution}
In general, the PSF correction will cause extra bias in the shear
estimation. In order to isolate the CG bias, we measure the
brightness moments without applying any PSF correction methods in this
work, i.e. the CG bias will appear in any method.  Moreover, the
definition of our CG bias uses the ratio of ellipticity from images,
thus the estimate for the CG bias will not be changed by the
convolution of a small PSF. Let us denote the quantity with prime for
those convolved with PSF, i.e.,
%
\be
I'(\theta) = \int \d^2 \psi I(\theta) P(\theta-\psi).
\ee
%
The weighted brightness moment can be written as
%
\bea
Q_{ij} &=& \int \d^2 \theta W(\theta)\, f_{ij}(\theta) I(\theta ),\\
Q_{ij}' &=& \int \d^2 \theta W(\theta)\, f_{ij}(\theta)\int \d^2\psi I(\psi) P(\theta-\psi),
\eea
%
where $f_{ij}(\theta)$ is the function to characterize the brightness
moments, e.g. $f_{ij}(\theta)=\theta_i\theta_j$ for the second order
moment. We can replace the variable $\psi$ by $r=\theta-\psi$, and
Taylor expand with respect to $\psi$. Then the moment becomes
%
\bea
Q_{ij}' &=& \int \d^2 \theta W(\theta)\, f_{ij}(\theta) \int \d^2r I(\theta-r) P(r)\\
&\approx &\int \d^2 \theta W(\theta) f_{ij}(\theta) \int \d^2r P(r) \eck{I(\theta)-{\partial I(\theta) \over \partial r}r}, \nonumber \\
&=&Q_{ij} \int \d^2r\,P(r) - \int \d^2\theta\, W(\theta) f_{ij} \int \d^2r\, P(r) {\partial I\over \partial r}r.\nonumber
\eea
%
The integral of $P(r)$ in the first term independent of the image of
the galaxy, and equals to unity for normalised PSF. In case of
circular symmetric PSF or the asymmetry is small, the second term can
be neglect. $Q_{ij}'\approx p Q_{ij}$, where $p$ is only determined
by the size of PSF. Thus, for small PSF we have the approximation
%
\be
{Q^{cg'}_{ij} \over Q^{ncg'}_{ij}} \approx
{Q^{cg}_{ij} \over Q^{ncg}_{ij}}, \;
\ee
%
which means that the small circular PSF will not change the CG bias in
our definition.
%In Fig.\,\ref{fig:psftest}, we compare the CG bias before and after the deconvolution
%with the effective PSF. One can see that the two lines are almost overlapped.
